Several times the Glucks and Schwanders have intermarried; thus the Swander History by John Swander, D. D. , 1899, of Tiffin, Ohio.

Near Howenstein, Switzerland, lived the Schwanders with 10 sons. Frederick emigrated from Berne, Switzerland to Philadelphia in 1732. Frederick's eighty years old father and one hundred four year old grandfather walked six miles to see him embark.

Later Frederick moved to where Allentown, Pa. now stands and married. He sired two sons, Jacob and John Adam. John Adam died without children so all descendants in this country are from Jacob.

In 1775 Jacob married Barbara Guester or Gerster and was in the Revolutionary War; then the name changed to Swander.
John was born 19 June 1776 to Jacob and Barbara and married Elizabeth Glick, daughter of AII, Philip in 1800. They had twelve children; all except John I. Swander family came to Ohio with their Glick neighbors.
The third son of John and Elizabeth Swander was Frederick, named for his grandfather and married Eve "Polly" Glick another daughter of AII Philip.
Eve and Frederick's Mary was born 1816 and a son Daniel in 1818. At eighteen years Mary married Lewis Glick, 1st son of Johan Daniel and their children were Isaac Sylvester, Sarah (Miller), Hannah (Solt), Elizabeth (Fridley) and Levi J. who bled to death at twenty-two years and Lewis born six months after his father died in 1847. So Mary brought up six children.
Mary's great granddaughter Mabel Glick married her brother Daniel's great grandson Huber Johnston, Dec. 25, 1929. They lived in Decatur, Ill.
Catherine and Anna Swander were probably two of John and Elizabeth's twelve children. Catherine married John Glick, son of AI and Margaret Herr, Anna b 1802 married Benjamin Glick, son of AVII Peter.
Daniel (brother of Mary), 1st wife was Abolonia Hoyman who maybe was a sister of Elizabeth Hoyman who married AVII Peter's 4th son "Pony" Jacob,
"Pony" Jacob and Elizabeth died 1840 and 1842 leaving Joseph, David, Eliza and Noah (twins), Juliann and Sarah Ann (twins), and Loretta. Daniel and Abolonia cared for Juliann and Benjamin and Anna Swander cared for Loretta.
Children of John Glick and Catherine Schwander are Hetty, Reuben, Nathan, Judy, Aaron, Edward, Elizabeth, John S.
