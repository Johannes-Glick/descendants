<h1>Preface<a class="headerlink" href="#preface" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>This book has been compiled to furnish a record of part of the Glick family. It is about the descendants of Johannas and Magdalena Glick who came to America on October 23, 1754 from Hanau, Germany. They came on the ship Snow Good Intent from Amsterdam.</p>
<p>“Genealogy of the Glick Family,” 1918, Indianapolis, Indiana, by George Hewey Glick (1852-1932) furnished much of the early ancestry. His book was reprinted in 1981 with some corrections and additional material by Gladys Glick Guthrie at Hanover, Indiana.</p>
<p>At the time of reprinting it was apparent that more updating of records of descendants was desirable in order that these people might be identified in the family and that members of the family might understand their relationships more easily. This compilation carries records into 1982. At some later date further updating is indicated. Toward this, present day Glicks and relatives are encouraged to keep records that could be useful.</p>
<p>Family records, recollections, letters, certificates, photographs, and even a tintype have been invaluable as well as extremely interesting. (One realizes the need to make identifications and dates before these are forgotten.) Present day correspondence has located and brought many of these materials together and has established a bond between long-unheard-from or never-met relatives. Some have contributed their findings or verifications from checking various public records, church records, cemetery visitations, and places where the Glick families have lived. All the materials offered are appreciated and valued. It is impossible to include all the interesting details and pictures which one would like to use. Credits for information are not intended to overlook anyone of the many who has had a part in this work, even those not specifically cited. This is a family effort for the family.</p>
<p>Some of the names, dates and other details will differ from G. H. Glick’s 1918 publication and the 1981 reprinting. Wording and placement of materials in his book sometimes left meanings unclear. At points, possibly, he did some educated guessing or assuming which was often accepted later as positively identified material. Checking or rechecking of old records, matching records from different sources and using sources which he had not located or had not used, account for some of the differences. As with many families there is naming for relatives, intermarriage of families of German descent and remarriage after the death of a spouse which result in a confusion of name duplication. Another result is that some of the family can trace their ancestry back to Johannas through more than one line with an entanglement of relationships of various degrees.</p>
<p>The records of the descendants of Johannas and Magdalena are not complete even now. Johannas’ will and G. H. Glick’s assumptions of grave identification indicate that a son David was deceased.</p>
<p>Baptismal and death records show that son Henry left no living descendants. Son Frederick’s line is not traced in 1918 or in this compilation. Any daughters there may have been were not identified or noted.</p>
<p>Correspondence with seemingly unrelated Glicks has not been included in this book, but such should not be discarded. They may be identified later as relatives or as related to descendants of Glick immigrants other than Johannas and Magdalena who are engaged in tracing their ancestry.</p>
<p>The 1918 book described the background for the exodus of great numbers of people, the Palatines, from Germany to America. Among them were Johannas and his wife and their young children. They arrived at Philadelphia to register and take the oath of allegiance before eventually settling in Berks County, Pennsylvania. Other children were born to them before their deaths in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>George remained in Pennsylvania, although his widow and several descendants moved farther into the new country. Johann Daniel went to Fairfield County, Ohio to enter government land in 1801 or 1802. Shortly after, he brought his family and urged his brothers Philip and Peter to come also. Philip died (1806) at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on his way to bring his family. His widow and some of the family came with Peter when he brought his family. Daniel walked to the Pennsylvania line to meet relatives and was hauled back on a sled, never recovering, dying in 1806. Peter was ill on arrival in Ohio with his family and died in 1807. The migration continued through later generations into Indiana, Illinois and other places.</p>
<p>Stories and incidents reflect the roles of families and individuals in the making of our country’s history with their everyday lives:</p>
<p>Johannas’ will shows concern for Magdalena and how his sons are to provide supplies and services deemed appropriate at that time; mention of close ties with a church wherever the family was shows the importance of church in their lives; when a wife died a husband sometimes married her sister or other relative – when parents died the six or seven orphans were taken into the homes or care of various relatives, demonstrating the family feelings and responsibility; a move from Pennsylvania to Ohio was in schooner wagons while another from Ohio to Illinois was by train with money for the purchased, but yet unseen, farm sewn into the hem of the mother’s dress; a bride during the Civil War sent good reports of her new home which caused her brother to move his family there also, again noting how the family encouraged its members.</p>
<p>Special thanks are due to Clyde E. Glick, brother of Gladys Glick Guthrie, for the use of his copy of G. H. Glick’s book during the 1981 reprint and this work.</p>
<p>Cross references on these families were studied and checked by Sarah M. (Mrs. Victor) Glick and Gladys Glick Guthrie, Victor and Gladys being first cousins descended from Philip, Daniel and Peter. Sarah has kept updates from the Glick Family Reunion at Shelbyville, Illinois and with Gladys has brought up-to-date two short lines of Philip’s family. These had lived on farms adjacent to their grandfather’s farm. They did the same for another of Philip’s which attended the reunions.</p>
<p>George. Much information was supplied by Violet (Mrs. W. W.) Wells of Walla Walla, Washington. Her research supplied the names of Johannas and Magdalena’s parents and grandparents at Lohrhaupten Parish, Hanau, Hessen-Nassau Germany.</p>
<p>Philip. The grandchildren of Sarah Glick Doner and of Edmond Glick were researched by Vonnie Horsman of Shelbyville, Illinois and Lulu Horsman, Visalia, California. Children of Vivien T. Glick by Robert Glick, Torrence, California. The Rufus Glick family of Hope, Indiana by Gladys (Mrs. John Perry) Simmons and June (Mrs. Walter) Miller, Columbus, Indiana.</p>
<p>Daniel, from the first son, Solomon – Information was gathered by Lloyd Henry Glick, Columbus, Indiana.</p>
<p>From the Second son, Daniel, and his first wife, Catherine – Sarah M. (Mrs. Victor) Glick, Tower Hill, Illinois; Gladys Glick (Mrs. Ned Guthrie, Hanover, Indiana; Mrs. Jane (Dr. Steve) Pollis, Warren, Ohio.</p>
<p>From Adam, son of Daniel and his second wife, Eve – Ada (Mrs. Mitchell) Glick, Edinburgh, Indiana, and Sylvanus by John C. Glick of Columbus, Indiana.</p>
<p>Peter. Leah Eisaman (Mrs. Charles) Packard, Malinta, Ohio; Gerald Moore, Deshler, Ohio. Loretta Glick Zwayer family – Ernestine (Mrs. Charles) Weisschadel, Mineral Springs, Arkansas. (Ernestine furnished much in cemetery records, old baptismal records, and traveling to Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois to check previous records.)</p>
<p>Among those whom we wish to thank are Hanover College and its President John E. Horner, for use of equipment to produce the book; Jerry Brawner, Manager of the Mail Room, for printing, binding, and assembling; Walter Morrill, Director of Libraries, for making the stencils; Dianne (Mrs. Frank) Barnes, secretary to the Director of the Brown Campus Center, for the typing; Frank S. Baker, Prof. Emeritus of journalism, for his time and invaluable help with the pictures, arrangement of materials, technical advice, and coordinating the final processes.</p>
<p>In the 1981 Genealogy of the Glick Family the identification of the full page picture following pages 134-135 is in error. The correct identification may be found in this book on p. 49.</p>

<h2>EXPLANATION OF THE CODE TO LOCATE YOUR FAMILY<a class="headerlink" href="#explanation-of-the-code-to-locate-your-family" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The letter A denotes the seven sons of Johannes and Magdalena Glick, the Roman numeral showing the order of their birth: A1 John George, A2 Philip, A3 David, A4 Henry, A5 Johan Daniel, A6 Frederick, and A7 Peter.</p>
<p>B in front of a name, refers to children of the above, another generation. The numeral indicates the number of children in each family, in the order of their birth.</p>
<p>C designates children of the B generation, with the numerals again showing the size of the family.</p>
<p>Each generation will be noted with a new letter.</p>
<p>As with an outline, a lot of space (or pages) may be required for the larger families or ones with many succeeding generations. Therefore, the rest of the brothers and sisters of the C generation, for example, may not appear until several pages later.</p>
<p>It will be necessary to pay close attention to the letters and numerals to follow your branch from the original seven brothers.</p>
<p>Most persons are listed separately with the appropriate letters and numerals. Their names will be followed by known information of birth, death, burial, spouse’s name and dates, marriage date, and their children’s first names. Occasionally occupations and addresses are included. The children’s names are underlined in many of the older generations for easier reference.</p>
<p>In cases of 2nd and 3rd spouses, the name is listed again with the same letter and numeral, after the children of the previous marriage. Information on the new spouse and subsequent children will then appear.</p>
<p>In following a line of Glicks, Eisamans, or Zwayers, the Glick name is not added each time when it is obvious the name is Glick. When a girl marries, her married name is repeated.</p>
<p>When you locate your immediate family, write the page number in the front for quick reference, as there are over 500 living families listed and no easy index.</p>
<p>George H. Glick gave us our early information in his 1918 publication. Sarah M. Glick made an outline from it and we have added later generations from close relatives. This book includes only a small portion of Glicks, compared to all who carry the Glick name. Some families are from two lines and could be listed twice, so you may be referred to the other line. Examples are Ada Newby under Enos Peter or Adam; Isaac Sylvester and Juliann under Lewis and Mary Swander or under “Pony” Jacob; Ora and Charles under Isaac Sylvester or under “Pony” Jacob’s David; Elmer Glen and Juanita under Lewis and Jane Springstun or under Edmond’s Arthur; Levi E. Zwayer under A2 Anna Magdalena Hall or under Loretta Zwayer.</p>
