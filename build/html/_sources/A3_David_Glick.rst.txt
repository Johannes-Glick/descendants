A3 - David Glick's Descendents
##############################

From the 1918 publication I am assuming David was born in Germany and came with his brothers John George b 1749 and Philip b 1750 to Philadelphia. Apparently David died young and his parents were buried beside him in the Wessnerville Cemetery at the Freiden Church built in 1768. Johannes died 1783 and Magdalena 1790.
