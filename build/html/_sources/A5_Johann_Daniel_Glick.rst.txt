**A5 Daniel Glick**
I find there is a difference in the birth date of Daniel in the 1918 publication, page 57, if his name was Albrecht Daniel born 1752. I think David may have been born in Germany 1752 and died young in Pa and his parents buried beside him (page 34 in the 1918 Book).

A more reliable birth record of Johannes and Magdalena's three younger children are the baptism records of Rev. Daniel Schumacker's in the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Allemangel, Pa. Johan Daniel Gluck baptized July 11, 1758 at four weeks old. Witnessed by Johannes and Magdalena Gluck and sponsored by Maria and Elizabeth Mindelsin, both single. Same place George Frederick baptized Nov. 11, 1760, born four weeks before at Allemangel.

And Johan Peter born Jan 2, 1768 baptized Jan 27, 1768 at home in Allemangel.

Now, a little summary of the Daniel Glicks before listing Daniel Jr.

The family moved to Fairfield Co., O. (a forest) in 1803 or 1804. Later Johan Daniel walked to the Pa. state line to meet relatives, was hauled back on a sled and was the first to be buried in the Glick or Salem churchyard about 1806 (page 29, 1918 Book).

They came from Canal Winchester, O. to Pana, Ill. by train. Wagons, furniture and animals were in a box car. There was no drinking water so the younger children cried themselves to sleep. They walked a mile or two between stations at Indianapolis carrying their food for the trip which took two days, Mar. 15-17, 1870. Juliann had $1000 sewed in the hem of her dress to pay for the 80A bought sight unseen. The roads were nearly axle deep with mud so the horses were exhausted then people loaned their horses. The six children were 4 months to 12 years old. ch Orlando, George, Levi, Luella, Charles, William and Ora h 1874.

Early children had many responsible chores. The Isaac Sylvester farm had a small spring along the road (and is still active) where butter and milk were kept cool between meals.

Will remembered his mother asked him to bring cookies from the cellar when the preacher came for Sunday dinner. Will replied "There are none." because he had eaten them, which his mother had discovered. He also remembered being covered with snow when he awoke to climb the ladder downstairs.

Isaac and Juliann celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary 1907 which was unusual in those days. A basket dinner was followed by a religious service in the grove attended by community friends and Ohio relatives. A family picture was taken and 2 of the...

Apparently, when George began going out alone at night, he came home one night and thought somebody was standing at the door. George hit him and was surprised to find it was mother's cottage cheese bag hanging at the door to drain in its usual place.

Walter Sr. was quite sick and living in the small converted school house at the foot of the hill. Irl was at grandfather's when Walter asked for Irl. Irl was stood beside his father's bed. Irl remembers his father putting his hand on his head and saying "God bless you, Little Man," turned over and died. Irl also remembers playing in the attic space under the roof at grandfather's and accidentally stepping into a large jar of maple syrup. Grandma washed him up and grandfather spanked him. Next morn, mother, Irl and Walter were at grandpa's to pick cherries. Grandpa tried to talk with Irl but Irl remembered the spanking and tried to spit in his face.

F6 Ross Sylvester Glick
=======================
- **Born:** 7 Nov 1905
- **Occupation:** Farmer, Tower Hill, Ill.

This story about Ross as I remember it and from a paper clipping at the time.

After lunch Saturday March 21, 1908, when Ross Glick was less than two and one half years old, he started to follow his father Charles Glick to Tower Hill four miles north. At the turn in the road, apparently Ross went in the opposite direction on a less traveled road, then continued through the woods and underbrush.

My family also went to Tower Hill for a family picture, which was made and we hurried home when we heard Ross was missing. My father didn't change his good clothes but jumped on a horse for the all-night search with neighbors. By morning they decided to drag Simmons' big pond and ordered blood hounds from Decatur fifty miles north.

By 9:00 a.m. Sunday morning, Civil War veteran George Payne, an uncle of Mrs. Orlando Glick, found Ross tangled in his wire hog pen across from New Hope Church.

Payne hadn't heard of Ross being lost so carried him west to neighbor Sparr's who had children.

George Payne carried Ross through the woods nearly a mile when Ross exclaimed "Papa's Barn" but he was unable to tell a thing about his adventure. He only remembers there were lots of people around and he had eggs for breakfast. His clothes were torn and muddy and evidence he had spent time in the hog pen with the warmth of the hogs as it was a cold night though he suffered no ill effects.

Very few people had telephones in that area though Ross' parents and grandparents Isaac and Juliann had phones which I remember were often used that night.
